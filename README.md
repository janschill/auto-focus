# Auto-Focus

Automatically enable Do Not Disturb mode when you're in deep work.

Auto-Focus periodically checks what application is in the front and enables Do Not Disturb mode after 12 minutes of focused work in your chosen applications. When you switch to non-work apps, it gives you a buffer period before re-enabling notifications.

## How Does It Work?

Auto-Focus runs as a menu bar app that monitors which application is currently active. When you're using one of your designated focus applications (like VSCode, Xcode, or any other app you choose), it starts a timer. Once you've been focused for 12 minutes (configurable), it automatically enables Do Not Disturb mode.

To prevent losing focus during quick context switches (like checking documentation), Auto-Focus includes a configurable buffer period. This means your focus session won't end immediately when you switch apps - you have a grace period to switch back to your work.

## Getting Started

1. Download the latest version of Auto-Focus from the releases page
2. Since the app isn't notarized yet, you'll need to:
   - Either: Open System Settings â†’ Privacy & Security, and click "Open Anyway"
   - Or: Remove the quarantine attribute by running:
     ```sh
     xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/auto-focus.app
     ```
3. Install the required Shortcut:
   - Open the Shortcuts folder in the downloaded DMG and install the Shortcut
   - or later through Settings of the app iteself
4. Launch Auto-Focus and configure your focus applications
5. Enjoy your uninterrupted work sessions! ðŸš€

## Future Plans

### Pay Apple 99 USD

Just to make this app really installable one needs to pay 99 USD to be able to get their apps notarized, this doesn't even mean one could distribute it through the Mac App Store.

### More Integrations

- **Slack Integration**: Set Slack status automatically and manage notifications
- **Calendar Integration**: Respect your meeting schedule and adjust focus mode accordingly
- **More Focus Providers**: Support for other focus/DND implementations beyond macOS Focus

### Enhanced Detection

- **Activity Detection**: Smarter detection of actual work vs. idle time
- **Context Awareness**: Better understanding of work contexts and patterns
- **Custom Rules**: Allow users to create their own rules for when to enable/disable focus mode

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues and pull requests.

**Note:** This project evolved from a simple Go script to a full-featured macOS application, maintaining the same core principle: helping you stay focused when you're in the flow.
