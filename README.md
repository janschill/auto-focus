# Auto-Focus

Automatically enable Do Not Disturb mode when you're in deep work.

Auto-Focus periodically checks what application is in the front and enables Do Not Disturb mode after 12 minutes of focused work in your chosen applications. When you switch to non-work apps, it gives you a buffer period before re-enabling notifications.

## How Does It Work?

Auto-Focus runs as a menu bar app that monitors which application is currently active. When you're using one of your designated focus applications (like VSCode, Xcode, or any other app you choose), it starts a timer. Once you've been focused for 12 minutes (configurable), it automatically enables Do Not Disturb mode.

To prevent losing focus during quick context switches (like checking documentation), Auto-Focus includes a configurable buffer period. This means your focus session won't end immediately when you switch apps - you have a grace period to switch back to your work.

## Getting Started

1. Download the latest version of Auto-Focus from the releases page
2. Install the required Shortcut:
   - Open the Shortcuts folder in the downloaded DMG and install the Shortcut
   - or later through Settings of the app iteself
3. Launch Auto-Focus and configure your focus applications
4. Enjoy your uninterrupted work sessions! üöÄ

## üöÄ Release Guide

This section is for the developer (future me) to remember how to create new releases.

### Prerequisites

1. **Code Signing Setup**: Ensure you have Developer ID certificates in Keychain
2. **Notarization Setup**: Configure notarytool credentials
   ```bash
   xcrun notarytool store-credentials "Developer" --apple-id "apple@janschill.de" --team-id "LKQJ2JG34Y"
   ```
3. **GitHub CLI**: Install and authenticate
   ```bash
   brew install gh
   gh auth login
   ```

### Complete Release Workflow

The entire release process is automated with a single command:

```bash
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  One-command release (does everything!)
make manual-release
```

This command will:
1. ‚úÖ Build and archive the app
2. ‚úÖ Prepare app for notarization  
3. ‚úÖ Create notarization ZIP
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è  **PAUSE** - You must manually notarize (see output)
5. ‚úÖ Package extension and generate version metadata
6. ‚úÖ Update website download links
7. ‚úÖ Stage files in git
8. ‚úÖ Create git tag with date-based version (e.g., v2025.06.15)
9. ‚úÖ Create GitHub release with assets
10. ‚úÖ Provide final push instructions

### Manual Step-by-Step (if needed)

If you prefer to control each step:

```bash
# 1. Prepare app for notarization
make prepare-app-for-notarization

# 2. Notarize (follow the output instructions)
xcrun notarytool submit 'build/auto-focus_notarization.zip' --keychain-profile 'Developer' --wait
xcrun stapler staple 'build/auto-focus_temp.app'

# 3. Package and deploy
make package-app
make deploy-downloads

# 4. Create git tag and GitHub release
make create-github-release

# 5. Push to deploy
git push origin main
```

### Notarization Process

When you see "‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Ensure the app is notarized", run:

```bash
# Submit for notarization (this takes 1-5 minutes)
xcrun notarytool submit 'build/auto-focus_notarization.zip' --keychain-profile 'Developer' --wait

# If successful, staple the notarization ticket
xcrun stapler staple 'build/auto-focus_temp.app'
```

### Version Strategy

- **Date-based versions**: `2025.06.15` (year.month.day)
- **Git tags**: `v2025.06.15`
- **Single version tracking**: Only latest version in git, older versions in GitHub releases
- **Backward compatibility**: App handles version management internally

### Distribution Strategy

- **Primary**: Direct downloads from https://auto-focus.app/downloads/
- **Backup**: GitHub releases for version history
- **Formats**: ZIP (primary), DMG (optional with `make create-dmg`)

### Troubleshooting

**Notarization fails**: Check logs with:
```bash
xcrun notarytool log <submission-id> --keychain-profile 'Developer'
```

**GitHub CLI issues**: Re-authenticate:
```bash
gh auth login --scopes repo
```

**Build issues**: Clean and retry:
```bash
make clean
make manual-release
```

### Release Checklist

- [ ] Code is committed and pushed to main
- [ ] Tests pass locally (`make test`)
- [ ] App builds and runs correctly
- [ ] Browser extension works (if changed)
- [ ] Run `make manual-release`
- [ ] Follow notarization instructions
- [ ] Verify website updates at auto-focus.app
- [ ] Test download links work
- [ ] Push final changes: `git push origin main`

### Post-Release

After release:
- [ ] Verify auto-focus.app serves new files
- [ ] Check GitHub release page
- [ ] Test download and installation
- [ ] Update any documentation if needed

**Remember**: The `manual-release` command does most of the work. Just follow the notarization steps when prompted! üéâ
